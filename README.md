# Okta Actions

Introducing Okta Actions for Zendesk. An app based on the Zendesk app framework that allows IT admins to quickly execute Okta user tasks in Zendesk such as:

    Reset Passwords
    Unlock accounts
    Suspend accounts
    Deactivate accounts
    Delete existing sessions
    Reset Multifactor enrollments (NEW!)

To install, download the app zip (OktaActions.zip) from Github. Log into your Zendesk instance >> Settings >> Apps >> Manage >> Upload private app

The app is also available on the Zendesk Marketplace but might be a bit behind because of the approval process.

During installation, you will need to provide the following:

    Okta Subdomain (eg. xyz.okta.com; enter xyz)
    Okta API Key (https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/overview/)
    Also optionally you can display or hide some of the user information if needed

Please note this is not an official Okta app.
